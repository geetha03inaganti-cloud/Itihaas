Itihaasa is an AI-powered digital heritage platform designed to revive and preserve historical monuments and cultural narratives that time has eroded. Tourists and students often encounter heritage sites in damaged or incomplete forms, making it difficult to visualize their original grandeur or understand their cultural, literary, and architectural significance. Itihaasa addresses this gap through intelligent reconstruction and contextual storytelling.

By allowing users to upload images of existing historical sites, Itihaasa generates AI-driven visual reconstructions that depict how these monuments may have appeared in their prime. Beyond visuals, the platform connects each site to its regional heritage—highlighting local traditions, ancient crops, traditional cuisine, poets, inscriptions, and historical events associated with the location.

The solution creates an immersive, interactive learning experience that bridges the gap between history and modern technology. Itihaasa is built with scalability in mind, enabling expansion across regions and cultures while supporting education, tourism, and cultural preservation at scale.
